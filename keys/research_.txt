Generated by Question: Scientific research begins with a question that stems from curiosity or a perceived gap in understanding. This question sets the research's direction and defines the problem to be investigated. The question should be specific, clear, and well-defined to ensure the research process remains focused.

Requires Clarification of Goals: Before starting research, researchers need to outline their objectives and goals. These objectives guide the research process and help researchers stay on track. Clear goals also facilitate the design of experiments, selection of methods, and interpretation of results.

Involves Specific Programme of Work: A research plan outlines the step-by-step process for conducting the study. This plan includes details about the research design, data collection methods, tools or instruments to be used, and a timeline for each phase of the research. Having a structured program of work helps maintain consistency and ensures that the research is conducted systematically.

Reiterative in its Activities: The scientific method often involves a cycle of activities. Researchers formulate a hypothesis, design experiments, gather and analyze data, interpret results, and then refine or revise their hypotheses based on findings. This iterative process allows researchers to refine their understanding and continually build upon their knowledge.

Divides Key Question into Sub-Questions: Complex research questions are broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-questions. This breakdown aids in organizing the research process and addressing specific components of the larger question. Each sub-question contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the main problem.

Tentatively Guided by Assertions or Claims: Hypotheses are educated guesses or statements that researchers make about the relationship between variables. These hypotheses are derived from existing theories, observations, or prior research. Researchers design experiments or studies to test these hypotheses and determine whether they can be supported or rejected based on empirical evidence.

Requires Measurable Data to Answer Questions: Empirical research relies on measurable data that can be quantified and analyzed. This data could be collected through various methods, such as observations, surveys, experiments, or measurements. The data collected should be reliable, valid, and relevant to the research question at hand.

Throughout the entire research process, from formulating questions to drawing conclusions, critical thinking and objectivity are essential. Researchers aim to minimize bias and errors in their methods and interpretations. Peer review and replication are also crucial components of the scientific method, as they provide opportunities for other researchers to validate and build upon the findings.

Ultimately, research conducted using the scientific method contributes to the advancement of knowledge by providing evidence-based insights, supporting or refining existing theories, and addressing practical problems in various fields of study.
